# Credit-Default-Prediction
Data Analytics Certification Program - Credit Default Prediction

This project was part of the Data Analytics Certification Program.  The scenario of this project is described in this hypothetical scenario in which each of the students in the program are asked to analyze and develop a model on a given set of credit default data.  The details of the scenario are as follows:

In this course, you are a Data Scientist for a company called Credit One, which is a third-party credit rating authority that provides retail customer credit approval services to businesses.

Credit One has tasked you with examining current customer demographics to better understand what traits might relate to whether or not a customer is likely to default on their current credit obligations. Understanding this is vital to the success of Credit One because their business model depends on customers paying their debts.

Your job as a Data Scientist will be to identify which customer attributes relate significantly to customer default rates and to build a predictive model that Customer One can use to better classify potential customers as being ‘at-risk’, compared to previously implemented models. You will use ensemble machine learning classification methods in Python for this task.

Initial Presentation.pptx is a presentation I created to explain to Credit One management, the process that I would follow in analyzing the default data and some initial thoughts about the data.

Complete - EDA and Model Build.ipynb and .html files are the python code and results from performing exploratory data analysis and building a model for predicting default.

Final Report.docx summarizes the analysis and results of the model.
